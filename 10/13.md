The team from Project r500 wants to replace their Ingress (networking.k8s.io) with a Gateway Api (gateway.networking.k8s.io) solution. The old Ingress is available at /opt/course/13/ingress.yaml.

Perform the following in Namespace project-r500 and for the already existing Gateway:

1. Create a new HTTPRoute named traffic-director which replicates the routes from the old Ingress
2. Extend the new HTTPRoute with path /auto which redirects to mobile if the User-Agent is exactly mobile and to desktop otherwise
The existing Gateway is reachable at http://r500.gateway:30080 which means your implementation should work for these commands:

curl r500.gateway:30080/desktop
curl r500.gateway:30080/mobile
curl r500.gateway:30080/auto -H "User-Agent: mobile" 
curl r500.gateway:30080/auto

Question 13 | Gateway Api Ingress
 

Solve this question on: ssh cka7968

 

The team from Project r500 wants to replace their Ingress (networking.k8s.io) with a Gateway Api (gateway.networking.k8s.io) solution. The old Ingress is available at /opt/course/13/ingress.yaml.

Perform the following in Namespace project-r500 and for the already existing Gateway:

Create a new HTTPRoute named traffic-director which replicates the routes from the old Ingress

Extend the new HTTPRoute with path /auto which redirects to mobile if the User-Agent is exactly mobile and to desktop otherwise

The existing Gateway is reachable at http://r500.gateway:30080 which means your implementation should work for these commands:

curl r500.gateway:30080/desktop
curl r500.gateway:30080/mobile
curl r500.gateway:30080/auto -H "User-Agent: mobile" 
curl r500.gateway:30080/auto
 

 

Answer:
Comparing for example the older Ingress (networking.k8s.io/v1) and newer HTTPRoute (gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1) CRDs then they look quite similar in what they offer. They have a different config structure but provide the same idea of functionality.

The magic of the Gateway Api comes more to shine because of further resources (GRPCRoute, TCPRoute) and the architecture which is designed to be more flexible and extendable. This will provide better integration into existing cloud infrastructure and providers like GCP or AWS will be able to develop their own Gateway Api implementations.

 

Investigate CRDs
It was mentioned that a Gateway already exists, let's verify this:

➜ ssh cka7968

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ k get crd
NAME                                        CREATED AT

snippetsfilters.gateway.nginx.org           2024-12-28T13:11:23Z

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ k get gateway -A
NAMESPACE      NAME   CLASS   ADDRESS   PROGRAMMED   AGE
project-r500   main   nginx             True         2m

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ k get gatewayclass -A
NAME    CONTROLLER                                   ACCEPTED   AGE
nginx   gateway.nginx.org/nginx-gateway-controller   True       2m12s
We can see that various CRDs from gateway.networking.k8s.io are available. In this scenario we'll only work directly with HTTPRoute which we need to create. It will reference the existing Gateway main which references the existing GatewayClass nginx:

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ k -n project-r500 get gateway main -oyaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
...
  name: main
  namespace: project-r500
spec:
  gatewayClassName: nginx
  listeners:
  - allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Same
    name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
...
 

Investigate URL reachability
We can already contact the Gateway like this:

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ curl r500.gateway:30080
<html>
<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>
</body>
</html>
We receive a 404 because no routes have been defined yet. We receive this 404 from a Nginx because the Gateway Api implementation in this scenario has been done via the Nginx Gateway Fabric. But for this scenario it wouldn't matter if another implementation (Traefik, Envoy, ...) would've been used, because all will work with the same Gateway Api CRDs.

The url r500.gateway:30080 is reachable because of a static entry in /etc/hosts which points to the only node in the cluster. And on that node, as well as on all others if there would be more, port 30080 is open because of a NodePort Service:

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ k -n nginx-gateway get svc
NAME            TYPE       CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-gateway   NodePort   10.103.36.0   <none>        80:30080/TCP   58m
 

Step 1
Now we'll have a look at the provided Ingress Yaml which we need to convert:

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ vim /opt/course/13/ingress.yaml
# cka7968:/opt/course/13/ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: traffic-director
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: r500.gateway
      http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              service:
                name: web-desktop
                port:
                  number: 80
            path: /desktop
            pathType: Prefix
          - backend:
              service:
                name: web-mobile
                port:
                  number: 80
            path: /mobile
            pathType: Prefix
We can see two paths /desktop and /mobile which point to the K8s Services web-desktop and web-mobile. Based on this we create a HTTPRoute which replicates the behaviour and in which we reference the existing Gateway:

apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: traffic-director
  namespace: project-r500
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: main   # use the name of the existing Gateway
  hostnames:
    - "r500.gateway"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /desktop
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-desktop
          port: 80
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /mobile
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-mobile
          port: 80
After creation we can test:

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ k -n project-r500 get httproute
NAME               HOSTNAMES       AGE
traffic-director   ["r500.gateway"]   7s

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ curl r500.gateway:30080/desktop
Web Desktop App

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ curl r500.gateway:30080/mobile
Web Mobile App

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ curl r500.gateway:30080
<html>
<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>
</body>
</html>
This looks like what we want!

 

Step 2
Now things get more interesting and we need to add new path /auto which redirects depending on the User-Agent. The User-Agent is handled as a HTTP header and we only have to check for the exact value, hence we can extend our HTTPRoute like this:

apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: traffic-director
  namespace: project-r500
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: main
  hostnames:
    - "r500.gateway"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /desktop
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-desktop
          port: 80
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /mobile
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-mobile
          port: 80
# NEW FROM HERE ON
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /auto
          headers:
          - type: Exact
            name: user-agent
            value: mobile
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-mobile
          port: 80
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /auto
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-desktop
          port: 80
We added two new rules, the first redirects to mobile conditionally on header value and the second redirects to desktop.

If the question text mentions something like "add one new path /auth" then this doesn't necessarily mean just one entry in the rules array, it can depend on conditions. We added at first the following rule:

    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /auto
          headers:
          - type: Exact
            name: user-agent
            value: mobile
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-mobile
          port: 80
Note that we use - path: and header:, not - path: and - header:. This means both path and header will be connected AND. So only if the path is /auto AND the header user-agent is mobile we route to mobile.

If we would do the following then these would be connected OR and it would be wrong for this question:

# WRONG EXAMPLE for explanation
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /auto
        - headers:            # WRONG because now path and header are connected OR
          - type: Exact
            name: user-agent
            value: mobile
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-mobile
          port: 80
The next rule we added is the one for desktop, at the very end:

    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /auto
      backendRefs:
        - name: web-desktop
          port: 80
In this one we don't have to check any header value again because the question required that "otherwise" traffic should be redirected to desktop. So this acts as a "catch all" for route /auto.

We need to understand that the order of rules matters. If we would add the desktop rule before the mobile one it wouldn't work because no requests would ever reach the mobile rule.

Our solution should result in this:

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ curl -H "User-Agent: mobile" r500.gateway:30080/auto
Web Mobile App

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ curl -H "User-Agent: something" r500.gateway:30080/auto
Web Desktop App

➜ candidate@cka7968:~$ curl r500.gateway:30080/auto
Web Desktop App
Great, Gateway Api ftw!
